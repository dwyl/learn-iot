## *Why*?

A **[Raspberry Pi](https://vimeo.com/90103691)** (Raspberry Pi) is a 'mini computer' that was created to help people learn about the basics of computers. They are _great_ for resource to get started on learning about hardware as they consist of the basic components of a computer. Raspberry Pi can run on an OS, which means that we can talk to the computer with higher level languages like Javascript!

## *What*?
**Internet Of Things (IoT)** describes the [internetworking of physical devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things)... that basically means that multiple systems (e.g. computers and microprocessors) can talk to each other to do _awesome_ things.

An example is a 'Smart Home' which might consist of a thermometer, microprocessor, a server and a mobile. The thermometer might _measure_ the temperature of a room; the microprocessor might _read_ the temperature every 5 minutes and _send_ those results to a computer. This computer might then _save_ each measurement and send them to the Home Owner, displaying the measurements in the form of a _graph_ so that they can easily see their energy consumption.

**Raspberry Pi** runs on a Linux OS, called Raspbian.

## *How*?
A detailed set of instructions on how to install NodeJS onto Raspberry Pi can be found [here](http://thisdavej.com/beginners-guide-to-installing-node-js-on-a-raspberry-pi/). The instructions in the link above goes into details of getting WiFi on Raspberry Pi 2, setting up Remote Desktop and Windows File Share too.
